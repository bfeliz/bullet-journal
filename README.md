# Bullet Journal

## Description

An application that accepts user input into a bullet journal format to organzine one's tasks.

The user creates an account with an email and password, then they are presented with the main screen of the app.

The user can then add tasks/goals to the different sections in the journal that are then saved onto an index page. The user can add tasks/goals by day or month and also add habits to a monthly habit tracker where they can keep daily track of habit completion.
